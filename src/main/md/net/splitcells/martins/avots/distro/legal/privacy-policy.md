# Notes
* Minimize the amount of things, that are guaranteed in the privacy policy,
  in order to minimize the amount of obligations.
* Things like the used server hoster/provider could also be given only on request,
  instead of writing it in the privacy policy.
  This minimizes the probability, that something is incorrectly/obsoletely stated in the privacy policy,
  because of things like server migrations.
